### Prerequisites of the Experiment

This experiment requires you to have basic knowledge about :

   - What a Tree is (parent, child, subtree in a tree)
   - What Prefixes and Suffixes of a word are
   - A basic understanding of what space and time complexity is

And above all, a curiosity to learn and explore!

### Overview of the Experiment

   - This experiment aims to help understand what a Trie data structure is and how it can be used to store words and find words in that list in a manner that is both space and time efficient.
  -  The experiment features a series of modules with video lectures, interactive demonstrations, simulations, hands-on practice exercises and quizzes for self analysis.
