### Prerequisites of the Experiment

This experiment requires you to have basic knowledge about :

   - [What a Tree is (parent, child, subtree in a tree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure))
   - [What Prefixes and Suffixes of a word are](https://www.enchantedlearning.com/grammar/prefixsuffix/index.shtml)
   - [A basic understanding of what space and time complexity is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity)

And above all, a curiosity to learn and explore!

### Overview of the Experiment

   - This experiment aims to help understand what a Trie data structure is and how it can be used to store words and find words in that list in a manner that is both space and time efficient.
  -  The experiment features a series of modules with video lectures, interactive demonstrations, simulations, hands-on practice exercises and quizzes for self analysis.
