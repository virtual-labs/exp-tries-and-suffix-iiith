**Programming Challenges:** If you have mastered Tries, write a program that Checks the Spellings of words in a file, and quickly reports all the misspelled words that exist. (Remember that the text is huge, so implement an efficient algorithm). You can try submitting this code [here](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/psets/5/speller/speller.html).
